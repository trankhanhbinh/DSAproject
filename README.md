## PACMAN - A Pacman-inspired game
This project is a simple Pacman-style game, showcasing object-oriented design, data structures, ghost AI behaviors, and console-based rendering.


## 🎮 Project Overview
The game features:
- A controllable Pacman navigating through a maze.
- Four ghosts with different behaviors.
- Collision detection, score tracking, and win/lose conditions.
- Lightweight console-based graphics using characters.


## 🛠️ Key Technologies
- **OOP design**
- **File handling** for map loading
- **Data structures**: arrays, vectors
- **Algorithms**: pathfinding logic, movement patterns


## 📁 Files
- `main.cpp` – Game entry point
- `Game.cpp / .h` – Core game engine
- `Map.cpp / .h` – Map loading & rendering
- `Ghost.cpp / .h` – Ghost behavior system
- `Pacman.cpp / .h` – Player controller


## 🚀 Features
- Smooth movement in the console
- Multiple ghost AI patterns
- Game loop with event processing
- Score calculation based on pellets eaten
